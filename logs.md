It's been some time since I've been fascinated by a strange idea I wanted to explore in my bots: working with what i'll call **Protocol chaining**. 

What I call Protocol chaining is related to my understanding of internet: as a node of Protocols interacting/altering/enacting data. Through Algorithms, data are going *from Protocols to Protocols* - and is consequently translated through these protocols logic's and structures.
