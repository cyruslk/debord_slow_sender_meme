It's been some time since I've been fascinated by a strange idea I wanted to explore in my bots: working with what i'll call **Protocol chaining**. 

What I call Protocol chaining is related to my understanding of internet: as a node of Protocols interacting/altering/enacting data. Through Algorithms, data are going *from Protocols to Protocols* - and is consequently translated through these protocols logic's and structures.

So the idea behind this project is to basically create a translation of [*La Société du spectacle*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_du_spectacle_(livre)) from original words (transfered and scraped with an OCR code) to Google Image results. Then from these Google Image results, have the images translated back from images to text.
